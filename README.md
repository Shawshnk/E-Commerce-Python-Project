This project aims to analyze e-commerce sales data to identify key trends, customer segments, and product performance. 
The analysis focuses on understanding customer purchasing patterns, identifying top-selling products, and uncovering potential areas for business improvement.

This analysis focuses on exploring and summarizing the e-commerce data using Pandas, a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. Key operations included:

*   **Filtering:** Selecting specific subsets of data based on criteria like date ranges, product categories, or customer demographics.
*   **Grouping:** Aggregating data based on different categories (e.g., grouping sales by product or region) to calculate summary statistics like sums, averages, and counts.

## Methodology
The analysis was conducted using Python with the Pandas library. Filtering was performed using boolean indexing and query methods, 
while grouping and aggregation were achieved using the `groupby()` method along with aggregation functions like `sum()`, `mean()`, `count()`, etc.
